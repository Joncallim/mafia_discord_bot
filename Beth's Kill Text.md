## Werewolves kill people...
1.	Night descends and all the villagers return home, but not all those who sleep stay sleeping. {Name} leaves their home in search of their love who promised them to a night of pleasures. But they never reached their lovers door, for with one fell swoop, {Name} was gathered up into the ferocious maw of the werewolf crouching on the rooftop awaiting its meal. All that was left was {Name}’s right hand, known well by their fair love.

2.	Night descends and all the villagers return home, but not all those who sleep stay sleeping. {Name} eagerly leaves their home in search of the outhouse. Their lantern clangs by their side as they waddle through the door, but they are soon interrupted by a looming shadows from above, their entrails splattered across the walls of the fateful outhouse.

3.	Night descends and all the villagers return home, but not all those who sleep stay sleeping. {Name} finds their way onto their roof for a look into the stars. Tracing the constellations with their fingers, they don’t notice the light from the moon being blocked out by the monster that lurks nearby. With nary a sound, {Name}’s life is ended as the stars blink down from the heavens.

4.	Night descends and all the villagers return home, but not all those who sleep stay sleeping. {Name} is sleeping soundly at their desk, an unfinished work of genius smudged against their cheek. A hairy arm reaches in through the open window, talons glinting in the moonlight, and snatches the body into the night. Shame, they only had another paragraph to go.

5.	Night descends and all the villagers return home, but not all those who sleep stay sleeping. {Name} cannot sleep, the ceiling taunting them with the promise of slumber. {Name} turns onto their right side and is greeted by two glinting yellow eyes. Needless to say, they got to sleep eventually.

5. Night descends, and all the villagers return home, but not all those who sleep stay sleeping. {Name} cannot sleep, the ceiling taunting them with the promise of slumber. {Name} turns onto their right side and is greeted by two glinting yellow eyes.
