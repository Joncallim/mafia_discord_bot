# Werewolf Bot Changelog
## Written for Discord in discord.py
---
### 21 May 2020:

- **Medic** and **Detective** classes added to the game (See README)!
- Added a daily loop to clean any idle server data from the bot's memory.
- Reworked the kill process so it takes medics into account.
- Removed various bugs and generalised the code a little more so that future classes can be added more easily.
